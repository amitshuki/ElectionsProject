# ElectionsProject
This project mimics an election providing two methods:
1. Citizens vote by districts (see DistrictBasedState)
2. Citizens vote without districts(see UnifiedState)

The user adds the districts, parties and citizens.
Then choose which citizen is voting and what party he is voting for.
Choose "Show voting results" to see the results of the elections based on the method the user choosed.

This is a educational program used to learn OOP and C++.
